Download the latest version from https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/27374 or https://github.com/fin-w/LibreOffice-Geiriadur-Cymraeg-Welsh-Dictionary and open the file with LibreOffice to install. Select "Welsh" as the document language in LibreOffice to use this extension for spellchecking.

This extension is based on Hunspell dictionary data developed by Bangor University. Numerous additional words are added to this extension's data with each new version, but through additional affixing rules, the total file size of the dictionary has been reduced.
